 . VGG19 is an advanced CNN with pre-trained layers and a great understanding of what defines an image in terms of shape, color, and structure. VGG19 is very deep and has been trained on millions of diverse images with complex classification tasks.
 
 VGG19 is a variant of VGG model which in short consists of 19 layers (16 convolution layers, 3 Fully connected layer, 5 MaxPool layers and 1 SoftMax layer).
